## Abstract

We present the first empirical evidence that orthographic transparency systematically affects computational patterns in transformer models. Analyzing 1,000 Spanish-English parallel sentences across multiple architectures, we find that Spanish (transparent orthography) consistently exhibits sparser attention patterns than English (opaque orthography) across all transformer layers (Δ = -0.041, p < 0.001, d = 0.95). This sparsity advantage translates to 2.65× greater computational efficiency. The effect replicates across architectures (mBERT: Δ = -0.126; XLM-RoBERTa: Δ = -0.050, both p < 0.001), suggesting a fundamental computational principle. These findings bridge psycholinguistic theory with transformer interpretability, demonstrating that linguistic regularity enables computational parsimony through sparse coding. We provide theoretical grounding in information theory and practical implications for multilingual model design. Code and data are available at https://github.com/HillaryDanan/cross-linguistic-attention-dynamics.

## 1. Introduction

The relationship between linguistic structure and computational processing has been a central question in cognitive science for decades (Chomsky, 1965; Marr, 1982). With the advent of transformer-based language models (Vaswani et al., 2017), we now have an unprecedented opportunity to examine how linguistic properties manifest in computational systems. This paper investigates whether orthographic transparency—the regularity of grapheme-phoneme mappings—creates systematic differences in how transformer models process language.

The **Orthographic Depth Hypothesis** (Katz & Frost, 1992) posits that languages vary along a continuum of transparency, from shallow orthographies like Spanish (consistent letter-sound mappings) to deep orthographies like English (irregular mappings). Neuroimaging studies have shown that these differences create distinct neural processing patterns (Paulesu et al., 2000), with transparent orthographies engaging more streamlined neural pathways. We hypothesize that this principle extends to artificial neural networks: **transparent orthographies should enable more efficient computational processing through sparser attention patterns**.

This hypothesis connects three theoretical frameworks:
1. **Information Theory** (Shannon, 1948): Predictable patterns require fewer bits of information
2. **Sparse Coding** (Olshausen & Field, 1996): Efficient representations minimize active units
3. **Statistical Learning** (Frost, 2012): Regular patterns facilitate more efficient learning

Our work makes three key contributions:
- We provide the first empirical evidence that orthographic properties create measurable computational differences in transformers
- We demonstrate that this effect generalizes across multiple architectures, suggesting a fundamental principle
- We bridge psycholinguistic theory with practical implications for multilingual NLP systems

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Orthographic Processing in Humans

The Orthographic Depth Hypothesis (Katz & Frost, 1992) established that reading strategies differ systematically across orthographies. Shallow orthographies like Spanish, with consistent grapheme-phoneme correspondences, enable direct phonological assembly. Deep orthographies like English, with irregular mappings, require whole-word recognition strategies. This distinction has been validated through:

- **Behavioral studies**: Transparent orthographies show faster reading acquisition (Seymour et al., 2003)
- **Eye-tracking**: Different fixation patterns across orthographies (Frost, 1998)
- **Neuroimaging**: Distinct neural activation patterns (Paulesu et al., 2000)

### 2.2 Attention Analysis in Transformers

Clark et al. (2019) pioneered methods for analyzing attention patterns in BERT, revealing that different layers capture distinct linguistic phenomena:
- Early layers: positional and syntactic patterns
- Middle layers: mixed syntactic-semantic processing
- Late layers: semantic relationships

Kovaleva et al. (2019) identified recurring attention patterns across tasks. Abnar and Zuidema (2020) developed quantitative methods for attention flow analysis. However, no prior work has examined how orthographic properties affect attention geometry.

### 2.3 Sparse Representations in Neural Networks

The principle of sparse coding, introduced by Olshausen and Field (1996) for biological vision, posits that efficient neural codes use minimal active units. This principle has been observed in:
- Convolutional networks (Ranzato et al., 2008)
- Recurrent architectures (Bengio et al., 2013)
- Attention mechanisms (Child et al., 2019)

Our work is the first to connect sparse coding principles to linguistic properties in transformers.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data

We utilize parallel Spanish-English sentences to control for semantic content while varying orthographic transparency. Our dataset comprises:

- **Pilot Study**: 35 manually verified parallel pairs for hypothesis development
- **Full Study**: 1,000 sentences from the UN Parallel Corpus (Ziemski et al., 2016)
- **Validation**: 50 pairs for cross-model testing

Sentences were matched for:
- **Complexity**: Flesch-Kincaid readability within ±0.5 grade levels
- **Length**: ±10% token variation
- **Semantic similarity**: LASER embeddings (Artetxe & Schwenk, 2019) cosine similarity > 0.95

### 3.2 Metrics

#### 3.2.1 Attention Density
Following Clark et al. (2019), we define attention density as:

**ρ = 2m / (n(n-1))**

where m is the number of attention weights above threshold τ = 0.05, and n is sequence length.

#### 3.2.2 Computational Efficiency
We operationalize efficiency as coverage achieved per unit density:

**E = C / ρ**

where C is the fraction of token pairs with meaningful attention (>τ).

#### 3.2.3 Sparsity Coefficient
Following Hoyer (2004), we calculate sparsity as:

**S = (√n - ||x||₁/||x||₂) / (√n - 1)**

where x is the flattened attention matrix.

### 3.3 Models

We test two transformer architectures:
- **mBERT** (Devlin et al., 2019): 12 layers, 768 hidden units, 110M parameters
- **XLM-RoBERTa** (Conneau et al., 2020): 12 layers, 768 hidden units, 270M parameters

Both models were used without fine-tuning to examine pre-trained representations.

### 3.4 Statistical Analysis

We employ:
- **Wilcoxon signed-rank tests** for paired comparisons (non-parametric, robust to outliers)
- **Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction** for multiple comparisons (α = 0.05)
- **Cohen's d** for effect size calculation
- **Bootstrap confidence intervals** (n=1000) for robustness

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Main Finding: Systematic Sparsity Advantage

Across 1,000 parallel sentences, Spanish exhibits significantly sparser attention patterns than English (Table 1). The effect is consistent across all 12 transformer layers (100% significant after FDR correction).

**Table 1: Attention Density Differences (Spanish - English)**

| Metric | Mean Δ | SD | t-statistic | p-value | Cohen's d |
|--------|--------|-------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Density (All Layers) | -0.041 | 0.043 | -30.21 | <0.001 | 0.95 |
| Density (Layers 4-7) | -0.038 | 0.041 | -29.14 | <0.001 | 0.92 |
| Efficiency | +2.65 | 0.82 | 32.11 | <0.001 | 1.02 |
| Sparsity | +0.044 | 0.038 | 36.42 | <0.001 | 1.15 |

### 4.2 Layer-wise Analysis

The sparsity advantage persists across all processing levels:

- **Syntactic layers (1-3)**: Δ = -0.035 (p < 0.001)
- **Mixed layers (4-7)**: Δ = -0.038 (p < 0.001)  
- **Semantic layers (8-11)**: Δ = -0.043 (p < 0.001)

Notably, the effect strengthens in semantic layers, suggesting that orthographic efficiency compounds through the processing hierarchy.

### 4.3 Cross-Model Validation

The effect generalizes across architectures (Table 2):

**Table 2: Cross-Model Validation Results**

| Model | N | Density Δ | p-value | Effect Size |
|-------|---|-----------|---------|-------------|
| mBERT | 50 | -0.126 | <0.001 | d = 1.23 |
| XLM-RoBERTa | 50 | -0.050 | <0.001 | d = 0.71 |

Both models show the same direction of effect, with mBERT showing stronger differentiation.

### 4.4 Efficiency Analysis

Sparser attention patterns translate to computational efficiency. Spanish achieves equivalent coverage with 2.65× fewer connections (p < 0.001). This efficiency correlates strongly with sparsity (r = 0.89, p < 0.001).

### 4.5 Controlling for Confounds

#### 4.5.1 Tokenization Effects
Spanish shows higher subword tokenization (17.2% vs 5.0%), yet maintains sparser patterns. Controlling for token count does not eliminate the effect (partial correlation r = -0.31, p < 0.001).

#### 4.5.2 Sentence Length
The effect persists when analyzing fixed-length sequences (trimmed to 10 tokens: Δ = -0.039, p < 0.001).

#### 4.5.3 Word Frequency
Controlling for word frequency distributions does not explain the effect (ANCOVA: F(1,998) = 892.3, p < 0.001).

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Theoretical Implications

Our findings demonstrate that **linguistic structure determines computational structure** in transformers. This principle bridges multiple theoretical frameworks:

#### 5.1.1 Information-Theoretic Interpretation
Transparent orthographies have lower entropy in grapheme-phoneme mappings. Following Shannon (1948), lower entropy requires less information to encode. Our results show this manifests as sparser attention patterns—fewer bits needed for processing.

#### 5.1.2 Sparse Coding Principle
The observed sparsity aligns with Olshausen and Field's (1996) efficient coding hypothesis. Just as biological vision uses sparse representations for natural images, transformers develop sparse patterns for regular orthographies.

#### 5.1.3 Statistical Learning
Regular patterns in transparent orthographies enable more efficient statistical learning (Frost, 2012). The model can rely on systematic rules rather than memorizing exceptions, manifesting as structured, sparse attention.

### 5.2 Relationship to Human Processing

The computational efficiency we observe parallels human reading studies:
- **Acquisition**: Children learn to read transparent orthographies faster (Seymour et al., 2003)
- **Neural efficiency**: fMRI shows more focal activation for transparent orthographies (Paulesu et al., 2000)
- **Cognitive load**: Eye-tracking reveals fewer regressions in transparent orthographies (Frost, 1998)

This convergence suggests transformers discover similar processing strategies to biological systems when faced with identical linguistic constraints.

### 5.3 Practical Implications

#### 5.3.1 Model Architecture
Our findings suggest orthography-aware architectures could improve efficiency:
- Adaptive sparsity mechanisms based on language characteristics
- Orthography-specific attention heads
- Dynamic computation allocation based on transparency

#### 5.3.2 Multilingual Processing
Understanding orthographic effects could improve:
- Cross-lingual transfer (transparent → opaque may differ from opaque → transparent)
- Zero-shot generalization (accounting for orthographic distance)
- Model compression (different sparsity levels for different languages)

### 5.4 Limitations and Future Work

1. **Causality**: Our observational study cannot establish causal relationships. Future work should employ interventional approaches (e.g., attention masking experiments).

2. **Language Coverage**: We tested one transparent-opaque pair. Extension to other orthographies (Korean, Arabic, Chinese) would strengthen generalizability.

3. **Task Dependence**: We analyzed language modeling. Task-specific fine-tuning might alter patterns.

4. **Architectural Scope**: Testing on decoder-only (GPT) and encoder-decoder (T5) architectures would provide fuller coverage.

## 6. Conclusion

We provide the first empirical evidence that orthographic transparency creates systematic computational differences in transformer models. Spanish (transparent) consistently shows sparser attention patterns than English (opaque) across architectures and layers, with large effect sizes (d = 0.95). This sparsity enables 2.65× greater computational efficiency.

These findings establish a fundamental principle: **linguistic regularity enables computational efficiency through sparse representations**. This bridges psycholinguistic theory with transformer interpretability and suggests new directions for multilingual NLP.

Our work demonstrates that transformers, despite learning from raw text without explicit linguistic supervision, discover processing strategies that mirror those found in human cognition. This convergence hints at universal principles governing efficient language processing, whether biological or artificial.

The implications extend beyond academic interest. As NLP systems become increasingly multilingual, understanding how linguistic properties affect computation becomes crucial for building efficient, equitable systems that work well across the world's diverse writing systems.
