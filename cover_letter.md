# Cover Letter - ACL/EMNLP Submission

Dear Program Chairs,

I am pleased to submit our manuscript "Orthographic Transparency Enables Computational Efficiency Through Sparse Attention Patterns in Transformer Language Models" for consideration at [ACL/EMNLP 2025].

## Summary

This paper presents the first empirical evidence that orthographic properties of languages create systematic computational differences in transformer models. Through analysis of 1,000 Spanish-English parallel sentences, we demonstrate that transparent orthographies (Spanish) consistently exhibit sparser attention patterns than opaque orthographies (English), with this sparsity translating to 2.65× greater computational efficiency.

## Key Contributions

1. **Novel Discovery**: We are the first to show that linguistic structure determines computational structure in transformers, with transparent orthographies enabling sparse, efficient processing.

2. **Robust Evidence**: The effect is large (Cohen's d = 0.95), statistically significant across all 12 transformer layers (p < 0.001 with FDR correction), and replicates across multiple architectures (mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa).

3. **Theoretical Bridge**: Our work connects psycholinguistic theory (Orthographic Depth Hypothesis) with transformer interpretability and information theory, establishing sparse coding as a universal principle.

4. **Practical Impact**: The findings have immediate implications for multilingual NLP, suggesting that orthography-aware architectures could improve efficiency and that different languages may benefit from different sparsity levels.

## Relevance to [ACL/EMNLP]

This work aligns perfectly with [conference]'s focus on:
- Empirical methods in NLP (rigorous experimentation with N=1,000)
- Multilingual processing (Spanish-English comparative analysis)
- Model interpretability (attention pattern analysis)
- Theoretical foundations (connecting linguistics with computation)

## Reproducibility

We are committed to open science:
- All code is publicly available: https://github.com/HillaryDanan/cross-linguistic-attention-dynamics
- Data uses publicly available UN Parallel Corpus
- Detailed methodology enables full reproduction
- Statistical analysis includes bootstrap confidence intervals and multiple comparison corrections

## Ethical Considerations

This research:
- Uses only publicly available data and models
- Has no negative societal impacts
- Could improve multilingual NLP equity by better understanding how different writing systems affect computation
- Supports more efficient models (reduced environmental impact)

## Review Suitability

The paper is self-contained and suitable for review by researchers familiar with:
- Transformer architectures and attention mechanisms
- Cross-linguistic NLP
- Statistical methods in computational linguistics

No specialized knowledge of psycholinguistics is required, as we provide necessary background.

## Declaration

- This manuscript is original work not published elsewhere
- It is not under review at another venue
- All authors have reviewed and approved the submission
- We have no conflicts of interest to declare

## Recommended Reviewers (Optional)
